    "thinking": "We are given a query: \"chen tang\"\n Result 0: Title='GitHub Pages', Snippet='Some info about chen tang research', Link='https://example.com'\n\n Steps:\n 1. The title is \"GitHub Pages\", which is generic. So we infer the name from the query: \"chen tang\"\n 2. The snippet says: \"Some info about chen tang research\" -> this suggests that the person's name is \"chen tang\", but note that in academic contexts, names are often written with the family name first. However, the query is given as \"chen tang\", so we'll take the name as \"Chen Tang\" (but note: the problem says to extract from the search results).\n\n 3. We need to fill:\n    - \"name\": string -> we'll use \"Chen Tang\" (but note: the query is \"chen tang\", so we can capitalize appropriately? However, the problem doesn't specify case. Since the result snippet says \"chen tang\", we can output as \"Chen Tang\" for proper capitalization? But the problem says: \"If title is generic like 'GitHub Pages', infer name from the query.\" -> so we take the query string and make it a name.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"Return ONLY the JSON array\". We have to be careful.\n\n    Let's think: the query is \"chen tang\". In the context of academic names, it's common to have the family name first. But the problem doesn: the query is given as \"chen tang\", so we'll output the name as \"Chen Tang\" (with capital first letter for each word) to be standard.\n\n    But note: the problem doesn't specify the exact formatting. However, the instruction says: \"Extract professor info\". We'll do:\n\n        name: \"Chen Tang\"\n\n 4. Affiliation: The result doesn't provide an affiliation. The title is \"GitHub Pages\", which is a generic title. The snippet doesn't mention an affiliation. So we set affiliation to null.\n\n 5. Role: The result doesn't specify a role. So we set role to null.\n\n 6. Confidence: We have to assign a confidence between 0.0 and 1.0. Since the title is generic and we are inferring the name from the query, and the snippet says \"chen tang research\", it's a bit weak. But we have the query and the snippet matches the query. Let's say 0"
